Logging in
1) Scan the RFID
2) Match the rfid with the client from the database(request the rfid from the broker and compare, if rfid exists say logged in and take the values from the db)
4) if not prompt to rescan the rfid(No such client exists in database, create one if needed)
5) Also, When a tag is read, the system should send an email to mention “ UserX entered at this time” idk if this works
6) Match the values with the ones from dashboard

Task 2)
1) Find nearby bluetooth devices
2) read the RSSI of each device
